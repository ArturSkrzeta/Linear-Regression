<h2>Linear Regression</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Linear Regression - approximating linear function to scatter data in order to find out the general trend.</li>
  <li>In regressing we want to predict continueous values as opposed to classification where we want to predict a classification of a case.</li>
  <li>Calculating line of regression:

  <li> Finding the best fit regression line with <b>gradient search</b>
    <br>
    - performing n iterations for different m
    - after every iteration, a predicted value y is being calculated
    - comparing distance between actual value and predicted one
    - when in iteration the distance between the predicted value and actual one is minimum - for this iteration we take m value for the best fit line
  </li>
